# Fingerprint Feature Extraction

- Creation of a synthetic fingerprint using the SFinGe program

- Obtaining a higher quality fingerprint than the original image by applying image preprocessing steps (conversion to binary, morphological operations (dilation, erosion), noise reduction, etc.) in this fingerprint.

- Removal of the skeleton of the fingerprint by the skeleton removal process.

- Finding the minutiae points on the fingerprint image that you extracted the skeleton from.

- Creating a database for the minutiae points you have obtained as follows.
